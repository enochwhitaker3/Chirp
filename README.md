# Chirp

A Twitter / X like React App currently in development by Enoch Whitaker.

## Elevator Pitch

Chirp is a Twitter/X-inspired social app where users can share quick thoughts limited to 50 characters and reply and interact with others in a feed style format. Interaction include reply to a 'chirp' or simplying 'liking' it. It takes what Twitter/X does well at its core, and removes all of the unecessary baggage.
